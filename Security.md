# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Since this is just for my own practice and learning, I'm not really "supporting" versions. 
Just use the latest code on the main branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Hey, if you find a way to make these codes even more "dangerous" or if I messed up 
a solution/fix, please dont just post it in the public issues. 

Drop me a message or open a PR with the fix so we can all learn how to harden 
the OS better. This is a safe space for learning ethical hacking
